      <description>Since childhood, the history of my hometown has profoundly impacted my imagination. Wandering around the streets of Warsaw, every footstep was permeated by the weight of the past, the scars left on the city during the Second World War. A city once enslaved by the German Nazi invaders, its buildings still carry the impressions, both tangible and invisible, of fervent combat. I remember developing a fascination for a symbol depicted on countless memorial plaques and walls.</description>

      <description>I am an emerging writer of historical fiction and a psychology graduate, currently based in Glasgow. Born to Polish parents, I grew up moving between France, Poland, and the U.S. and thanks to this developed a trilingual mindset. Across these experiences, I discovered that my heart would always be most attached to the city of Warsaw, where I spent 10 years immersed in its breathtaking history. In my first novel, Dust of Wrathful Years, I attempt to give a glimpse into Poland’s heritage, through the stories of young people fighting for the country’s freedom during the Second World War.</description>

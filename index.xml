      <description>I am an emerging writer of historical fiction and a psychology graduate, currently based in Glasgow. Born to Polish parents, I grew up moving between France, Poland, and the U.S. Across these experiences, I discovered that my heart would always be most attached to the city of Warsaw, where I spent 10 years immersed in its breathtaking history. In my first novel, Dust of Wrathful Years, I attempt to give a glimpse into Poland’s heritage, through the stories of young people fighting for the country’s freedom during the Second World War.</description>

      <description>1939⁣. Childhood is cut short by the outbreak of war. After a short-lived era of renaissance, Poland is once again being torn to pieces. The endless struggle for freedom returns. Children who were meant to live in a peaceful land are thrown into inescapable darkness.
Aniela, Jadzia and Kamil were simply adolescents growing up in a promising age of renewal. Part of a generation born with their homeland’s independence, they were to discover Poland as a free and thriving country… Only to later discover death and the destruction.</description>

                            <p><em>“I’m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.” – Anne of Green Gables</em></p>
<p>Something about autumn fills me with childhood nostalgia… This year it inspired me to reread a favorite book after 13 years… For what is a good children’s book if not one that can be enjoyed in adulthood?</p>
<p>My love for <em>Anne of Green Gables</em> began when I was 12, about the same age as the heroine at the start. She became my best friend in a season of loneliness and self-doubt, when I felt I could never fit in, thinking I was too weird and awkward to be accepted by my peers. Growing up with Anne, my dreamy INFP personality only became dreamier. I ran away to her world of dreams to forget about worries and imagine myself in good company. And yes, I did go through a phase of naming most of the trees in my grandma’s garden…</p>
<p>Perhaps Anne’s enthusiasm about the world around her seems over-the-top at times. Like something a girl should eventually grow out of. But as the years went by and I effortfully reduced my time spent daydreaming, I tried at least to cling to one of the habits Anne had taught me.</p>
<p>To <em>wonder</em> at the world. Gazing at the miracle of Creation with fresh eyes every day. Not to let any season pass by unnoticed. Whether it’s the fiery hues of autumn leaves, spring rain melting into the scent of cherry blossom or summer fields drowning in wildflowers and wheat. Anne had a talent for making ordinary, daily experiences of life appear extraordinary. Her imagination added color to bleak reality, but she was also more present and aware of beauty whenever it met her eyes.</p>
<p>When I read these books as a child, I used to think she must have been living in the most picturesque corner of the world. Then I realized the nature surrounding her was probably not that exotic compared to what I was used to. Simply, she gazed at everything in wonder, and with that approach every little hint of beauty can become magnificent.</p>
<p>When the same patterns repeat over and over again year after year, it’s so easy to take their beauty for granted. Yet every moment is unrepeatable, every place a unique treasure in God’s masterpiece. That’s why Anne would not let any of her favorite trees, ponds or hills remain unnamed. To acknowledge each of the wonderful gifts her eyes were granted to behold.</p>
<p>In this year’s golden autumnal light, I am trying to remember to wonder at the world around me. That means more than just noticing the pretty colors. It’s about allowing myself to admire the details as if my eyes perceived them for the first time. Childlike awe at the miracles of Creation is an ability we lose so easily. I am hoping that as I watch my daughter grow and discover the world, I can imagine myself sharing in the novelty. Because the beauty around us is a breathtaking path towards God’s greatness and glory.</p>

The intense joy in those first moments. Dazed and exhausted after hours of labor, I stepped into a new world. She’s here. Our daughter. I’ll never forget the moment I picked her up from the birth pool and held her in my arms. My first words to her. Kocham Cię Anielko. I love you, Aniela.
But after those initial exhilarating sparks came the inevitable exhaustion.</small>

                                            <small>June has always carried a unique sweetness. Long summer days, eating as many strawberries as possible, loud but warm thunderstorms, the scent of elderflower soaked by rain… My favorite time of the year for long strolls around town. Across the half-open church doors, I hear voices singing the litany to the Sacred Heart…
During my summers in Warsaw, every evening I would try to find a daily Mass followed by June devotions.</small>

                                            <small>Pentecost had a more special place in our family calendar this year, as we tried to truly bring the feast to life. And what a great joy it was to prepare a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit, as we anticipated His coming for the nine days since the Ascension.
Guided by the Spirit The Third Person of the Trinity can seem so abstract and volatile, difficult to grasp. I had to sit back in quietude to become more aware of His place in my life.</small>

                            <p><em>In Death Beloved</em>, the second book in my WWII trilogy, releases today – on the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising. I wanted to do something special to commemorate this day, and publishing a book turned out to be the best answer I found.</p>
<p>Its pages will bring to life some heroes of those days, stories of true historical figures intertwined with the fictional. While the events of August-September 1944 are at the heart of this story, there is much more to it than a simple recounting of battle details. Once again, I am hoping to introduce you to imperfect people who, amidst the reigning chaos, went beyond themselves to follow Truth. Even if all this meant sacrificing their lives in a desperate fight for freedom.</p>
<p>During the 5 years of German occupation and terror, the Polish Home Army secretly prepared for this final outburst - an open demonstration of their hatred of evil. And when that moment of ultimate confrontation came, the happiness flowing from it was irrepressible.</p>
<p>The Warsaw Uprising began with joy and elation, battle songs celebrating the long-awaited fight. Then, with deafening explosions, that breath of freedom was suppressed. Everything happened in a flash and yet time stretched on forever. Until the city turned to ruins. And an entire world vanished.</p>
<p>But what happened in between? 63 days of honor and bloodshed&hellip; I tried capturing something of this paradoxical atmosphere, the tragic blend of elation and sacrifice. Daily life during the uprising, the progressive downfall and discouragement, but also perseverance maintained until the end.</p>
<p>The insurgents’ battle might have been lost and their beloved city destroyed, but it is them that history remembers proudly. Not their enemies who were so threatening at the time. Victims and veterans of the Warsaw Uprising are still honored today. And for years after the war, survivors have testified that in those days, the call to fight was impossible to ignore – even when the enemy army evidently outplayed them.</p>
<p>Yet the world is rarely ever black and white. I tried to show some of these nuances and complexities, the struggles for healing and forgiveness. That even in such a world absorbed by hatred redemption is possible.</p>
<p>The words <em>Gloria Victis</em> – Glory to the defeated – are engraved to this day on monuments to the Warsaw Uprising, to those who fell in the battle. It is to them that I dedicate this book.</p>

                                            <small>Can war ever be just? If we agree that justice is necessary to any human society, then the question is merely under which conditions war would become just.
St Thomas Aquinas wisely assembled three necessary conditions for war to be just. Let us have a look at these.
1. Waged with sovereignty War ought to be waged by command of a sovereign, not an individual. In this way, will of the selfishness of an individual does not lead to redress.</small>

                                            <small>Writing the second part of my trilogy came with a new challenge – integrating more historical figures and events within a fictionalized narrative. Doing a wide amount of research came with the temptation of just rewriting a textbook, forgetting about my storyteller’s voice. It took me time to gain confidence in painting these historical players as real people rather than marble statues. Like anyone of us, they too had their own unique friendships, loves, joys and sorrows.</small>

                                            <small>In comparing my experiences as a writer and reader of historical fiction, I realized that there was little overlap between the two. I noticed something I paid little attention to earlier – that when directing myself towards this genre, I rarely chose novels set in the era I write about – the Second World War.
Perhaps that’s simply because I search for fresh air and need to set my eyes on something new.</small>

In comparing my experiences as a writer and reader of historical fiction, I realized that there was little overlap between the two. I noticed something I paid little attention to earlier – that when directing myself towards this genre, I rarely chose novels set in the era I write about – the Second World War.

Perhaps that’s simply because I search for fresh air and need to set my eyes on something new. Or I might be afraid of being implicitly influenced, and unconsciously mimic elements from others in my own writing. Because after discovering a deeply convincing structure, it’s difficult to just forget everything, snap out of it and create your own world. In the web of literature, everything is intertwined, writers draw from those before them, and we all recreate the drama of human existence in our own words with a personal focus on what speaks most to our hearts. In my eyes, it is impossible to fully reject the archetypes transcending eras and places. 

When reflecting on whether anything I read in historical fiction has inspired my own work, I did not think so at first. Until I realized that certain archetypal figures and situations had been influencing me, without my conscious awareness. 

Across my experiences as a reader, three classical historical fiction novels stood out to me by the depth of their voice. Each being set in a different period and country; they somewhat found a way to build a connection with my own work. Travelling across time and space, I encountered overarching themes that I later brought back to life when writing about the Polish resistance during the Second World War.

## *Quo Vadis* by Henryk Sienkiewicz

Set in ancient Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero, this book transports readers to the time of early Christians’ persecutions. While the main characters’ martyrdom is anticipated throughout the book, a tale of love unfolds between a Roman patrician and a young Christian woman. Even when their tragic fate was inescapable, I was attached to their journey, admiring especially their inner will to remain steadfast in the face of oppression. 
Thanks to his extensive research and literary genius, Sienkiewicz wonderfully blended historical events with fictional elements. The result is a vivid portrayal of life in ancient Rome and the struggles of early Christians under persecution. The novel not only entertains but also provides valuable insights into the complexities of human nature and the resilience of faith in times of adversity.

Something of this atmosphere reverberates in my work, in the resilience of Polish people against terror. The secrecy and persecution surrounding the first Christians can be found again in conspirers fighting the German occupant in Warsaw. In *Quo Vadis*, one scene particularly stuck to my memory, where the importance of symbols was made clear. Early Christians adopted the fish as a secret sign through which believers recognized one another. In my novel, I tried drawing an implicit parallel with the anchor – an emblem of the Polish resistance during WWII. 

*Quo Vadis* speaks of the victory of moral ideals over violence and tortures – a theme reignited in those who fought against Nazi German ideology. 

## *Gone with the Wind* by Margaret Mitchell

Set on the backdrop of the American civil war, *Gone with the Wind* focuses less on battles than on the entire fall of a civilization, and the trials of people surviving behind the frontlines. 

Here I was most impressed by the depth and breadth of character development, especially in the case of Scarlett O’Hara. From a spoiled, stubborn, and proud teenager, she turns into a determined woman using every bit of her strength to support her family with the scarce resources remaining, after the destruction brought by war. Her stubbornness is changed into an asset, pushing her through the roughest trials. Transformative and traumatic experiences lead her from being a child to looking after others. 

The author perfectly portrayed a ruthless dynamic, of war prematurely forcing youth into adulthood. In my work, I touch upon this same theme, where a generation is robbed of the brightest days of youth by the outbreak of WWII. 

Also, I must mention the sentiment I attach to the love story so masterfully crafted across the pages. One of my favorites in literature… 

## *Les Misérables* by Victor Hugo

For this masterpiece of historical and psychological fiction, I do not even know where to begin. I suppose that ever since a musical was created based on this novel, the main picture associated with *Les Misérables* is the revolution, the barricades… 

And yet, behind these vivid and memorable scenes, there is so much more to unpack.
Above all, I felt a powerful impact of the fight between good and evil, and the power of redemption. Thanks to these elements, *Les Misérables* soon became in my eyes an ideal for a psychologically convincing exploration of characters, and a vivid portrayal of a historical period and its societal struggles.
An integral part of this success is the author’s ability to show the interconnectedness of human lives. Past actions reverberate through the characters’ lives, affecting their choices and destinies. There is a reason for the length of the book – every character is explored in depth, their story unfolds over several years, without any shortcuts. I found this incredibly impressive, and thought-provoking. Many storylines are neatly crafted together, thus symbolizing the deep unity between men and women from various backgrounds. 

And from experience, I can tell that such coherence between numerous parallel stories is not easy to maintain, while simultaneously creating a natural flow across the pages.

Then there is the power of sacrifice, illustrated in the lengths to which people are willing to go for a cause they see as just or for those they love. Dedication to principles and personal values is clearly brought to life by Hugo. 

When recounting stories of the Polish resistance, I was also inspired to delve into these realms, to show how certain people went beyond themselves to fulfill their duty, to defend justice and human dignity in the face of all-encompassing evil. 

## Archetypes inspiring my writing 

All three of these works paint an image of love in the midst of war, instability, or persecutions. The strive for love in apocalyptic times is essential in my trilogy, *Dust of Wrathful Years*.

In the direst circumstances, life’s fragility and imminent threats of death coexist with hope. The young people I write about were thirsting for life, like anyone their age today. Yet they also knew that they were not given long to walk in this world. At the heart of everything, love was the only force able to effectively defend them against the surrounding horrors. Even when everything around suggested that mercy and compassion had departed from the surface of the earth.
